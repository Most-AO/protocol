Messages and other stuff transmitted by AO

MIPs stand for **MostAO Implementation Possibilities**

## Background

AO, the computer, is a promising new infrastructure that enables Web3 applications to deliver a Web2 experience. To enhance the AO ecosystem, a protocol is required to establish a standardized messaging system for processes to communicate.

## Conceptes

- Handle: A handle is the unique identifier, and is also a process that can send and receive messages.
- Session: There are different types of sessions, e.g. DM session, group session, channel session. Sessions are responsible for keeping conversation and rotate keys.
